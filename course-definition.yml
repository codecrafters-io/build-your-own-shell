stages:
  - slug: "oo8"
    name: "Print a prompt"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement printing a shell prompt (`$ `) and waiting for user input.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then check whether your shell prints the `$ ` prompt and waits for user input.

      ### Notes

      - There's a space after the `$` character in the prompt.
      - Your program must not exit after printing `$ `, it should wait for user input.
      - We'll handle reading commands and executing them in later stages, this stage only deals with printing the prompt.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement printing the shell prompt and waiting for user input.

  - slug: "cz2"
    name: "Handle invalid commands"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement support for handling invalid commands in your shell.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then send the following command to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ invalid_command
      invalid_command: command not found
      ```

      The tester will check whether your shell prints `<command_name>: command not found\n` for an invalid command.

      ### Notes

      - We're treating every command as "invalid" for now, but we'll handle executing "valid" commands like `echo`, `cd` etc. in later stages.
      - The command name will be a random string, so the response can't be hardcoded.
      - In this stage it's okay if your program exits soon after printing the `<command_name>: command not found\n` message. In later stages
        we'll check for a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), i.e. whether the shell prints a new prompt after processing each command.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement handling invalid commands in your shell.

  - slug: "ff0"
    name: "REPL"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement a [REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

      A REPL is an interactive loop that reads user input, evaluates it, prints the result, and then waits for the next input.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then send a series of commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ invalid_command_1
      invalid_command_1: command not found
      $ invalid_command_2
      invalid_command_2: command not found
      $ invalid_command_3
      invalid_command_3: command not found
      $
      ```

      After each command, the tester will check if `<command_name>: command not found` is printed, and whether a prompt is printed for the next command.

      ### Notes

      - The exact number of commands sent and the command names will be random.
      - Just like the previous stages, all commands will be invalid commands, so the response will always be `<command_name>: command not found`.

  - slug: "pn5"
    name: "The exit builtin"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the [exit](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#exit) builtin.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send an invalid command to your shell, followed by the `exit` command:

      ```bash
      $ invalid_command_1
      invalid_command_1: command not found
      $ exit 0
      ```

      After issuing the `exit 0` command, the tester will verify whether your program terminates with [code/status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) 0.

      ### Notes

      - The tester will always pass in `0` as the argument to the `exit` command.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `exit` builtin command.

  - slug: "iz3"
    name: "The echo builtin"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the [echo](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html) builtin.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `echo` commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ echo hello world
      hello world
      $ echo pineapple strawberry
      pineapple strawberry
      $
      ```

      After each command, the tester will check if the `echo` command correctly prints the provided text back.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `echo` builtin command.

  - slug: "ez5"
    name: "The type builtin: builtins"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `type` builtin command for your shell.

      The `type` builtin is used to determine how a command would be interpreted if used. Example:

      ```bash
      $ type echo
      echo is a shell builtin
      $ type exit
      exit is a shell builtin
      $ type invalid_command
      invalid_command: not found
      ```

      In this stage we'll only test two cases: builtin commands and unrecognized commands. We'll handle
      executable files in later stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `type` commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ type echo
      echo is a shell builtin
      $ type exit
      exit is a shell builtin
      $ type type
      type is a shell builtin
      $ type invalid_command
      invalid_command: not found
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `type` command responds correctly based on the command provided:

      - If a command is a shell builtin, the expected output is `<command> is a shell builtin`.
      - If a command is not recognized, the expected output is `<command>: not found`.

      ### Notes

      - The tester will only check for builtin commands and unrecognized commands in this stage.
      - `type` itself is a shell builtin command, so `$ type type` should print `type is a shell builtin`.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `type` builtin command.

  - slug: "mg5"
    name: "The type builtin: executable files"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll extend the `type` builtin to search for executable files using [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

      [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) is an environment variable that specifies a set of directories
      where executable programs are located. When a command is received, the program should search for the command in the
      directories listed in the PATH environment variable. If the command is found, the program should print the path to the command. If the command is not found, the program should print `<command>: not found`.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program with a custom `PATH` like this:

      ```bash
      PATH="/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `type` commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ type ls
      ls is /usr/bin/ls
      $ type valid_command
      valid_command is /usr/local/bin/valid_command
      $ type invalid_command
      invalid_command: not found
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `type` command correctly identifies executable files in the PATH.

      ### Notes

      - The actual value of the `PATH` environment variable will be random for each test case.
      - `PATH` can contain multiple directories separated by colons (`:`), your program should
        search for programs in each directory in order and return the first match.
      - Some commands, such as `echo`, can exist as both builtin commands and executable files. In such cases, the `type` command should identify them as builtins.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `type` builtin command for your shell.

  - slug: "ip1"
    name: "Run a program"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for running external programs with arguments.

      External programs are located using the `PATH` environment variable, as described in previous stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a command that you need to execute:

      ```bash
      $ custom_exe_1234 alice
      Program was passed 2 args (including program name).
      Arg #0 (program name): custom_exe_1234
      Arg #1: alice
      Program Signature: 5998595441
      ```

      The command (`custom_exe_1234`) in the example above will be present in `PATH` and will be an executable file.

      The executable file will print information about the arguments it was passed along with a random "program signature". The tester will verify that your program prints output from the executable.

      The tester will run multiple such commands and use a random number of arguments each time.

      ### Notes

      - The program name, arguments and the expected output will be random for each test case.
      - The output in the example ("Program was passed N args...") comes from the executable. It's not something you need to implement manually.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the ability for your shell to run external programs with arguments.

    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `pwd` builtin command.

      [pwd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd) stands for "print working directory".

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a `pwd` command to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ pwd
      /path/to/current/directory
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `pwd` command correctly prints the current working directory.

      ### Notes

      - The `pwd` command must print the full absolute path of the current working directory.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the ability for your shell to print the current working directory.

  - slug: "ra6"
    primary_extension_slug: "navigation"
    name: "The cd builtin: Absolute paths"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `cd` builtin command to handle absolute paths.

      The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory. `cd` can receive multiple
      argument types. In this challenge we'll cover:

      - Absolute paths, like `/usr/local/bin`. (**This stage**)
      - Relative paths, like `./`, `../`, `./dir`. (Later stages)
      - The `~` character, which stands for the user's home directory (Later stages)

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `cd` commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ cd /usr/local/bin
      $ pwd
      /usr/local/bin
      $ cd /does_not_exist
      cd: /does_not_exist: No such file or directory
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `cd` command correctly changes the directory when a valid path is provided. It'll
      also check whether the message `cd: <directory>: No such file or directory` is printed if the provided path is invalid.

      ### Notes

      - The `cd` command doesn't print anything if the directory is changed successfully. The tester will use `pwd` to verify
        the current working directory after using `cd`.

      In this stage, you'll extend your `cd` builtin command to handle relative paths.

      As a recap, `cd` can receive multiple argument types:

      - Absolute paths, like `/usr/local/bin`. (Previous stages)
      - Relative paths, like `./`, `../`, `./dir`. (**This stage**)
      - The `~` character, which stands for the user's home directory (Later stages)

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `cd` commands to your shell:

      ```bash
      $ cd /usr
      $ pwd
      /usr
      $ cd ./local/bin
      $ pwd
      /usr/local/bin
      $ cd ../../
      $ pwd
      /usr
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `cd` command correctly changes the directory when a valid path is provided. It'll
      also check whether the message `cd: <directory>: No such file or directory` is printed if the provided path is invalid.

      ### Notes

      - The actual directory names used will be random, so you can't hardcode the expected output.
      - Relative paths like `./`, `../`, and more complex relative paths should be handled correctly.
      - The `cd` command doesn't print anything if the directory is changed successfully. The tester will use `pwd` to verify
        the current working directory after using `cd`.

    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll extend your `cd` builtin command to handle the `~` character.

      As a recap, `cd` can receive multiple argument types:

      - Absolute paths, like `/usr/local/bin`. (Previous stages)
      - Relative paths, like `./`, `../`, `./dir`. (Previous stages)
      - The `~` character, which stands for the user's home directory (**This stage**)

      The `~` character is shorthand for the user's home directory. When `cd` is received with `~`, your shell should
      change the current working directory to the user's home directory. The home directory is specified by the
      [`HOME`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/123858/is-the-home-environment-variable-always-set-on-a-linux-system)
      environment variable.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh

      $ cd ~
      $ pwd
      /home/user
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `cd` command correctly changes the directory to the user's home directory when `~` is used.

      ### Notes

      - The `pwd` command will be used to verify the current working directory after using `cd ~`.
      - The home directory is specified by the `HOME` environment variable.

      In this stage, you'll implement support for quoting with single quotes.

      Every character within single quotes is interpreted literally, with no special treatment. Read more about quoting with single quotes [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Single-Quotes).

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      shell hello
      $ echo 'world     test'
      world     test
      $

      ```bash
      $ cat '/tmp/file name' '/tmp/file name with spaces'
      content1 content2
      ```

      The tester will check if the `cat` command correctly prints the file content.

      Within single quotes `'`, every character (including backslashes) is treated literally. No escaping is performed. Read more about quoting with backslashes within single quotes [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Single-Quotes).

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a series of `echo` commands to your shell:

      shell\\\nscript
      $ echo 'example\"testhello\"shell'
      example\"testhello\"shell
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the `echo` command correctly prints the quoted text.


      Then it will also send a `cat` command, with the file name parameters consisting of backslashes inside single quotes:

      Within double quotes `"`, a backslash escapes the following characters: `"`, `\`, `$`, `` ` ``, or newline. Read more about quoting with backslashes within double quotes [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Double-Quotes).

      In this stage, we’ll cover:

      - `\"` → escapes double quote, allowing " to appear literally within the quoted string
      - `\\` → escapes backslash, resulting in a literal \

      We won’t cover the following cases in this stage:

      - `\$` → escapes the dollar sign, preventing variable expansion
      -  `` \` `` → escapes the backtick, preventing command substitution
      - `\<newline>` → escapes a newline character, allowing line continuation

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash

      In this stage, you'll implement support for autocompleting builtin commands.

      Your shell should be able to complete builtin commands when the user presses the `<TAB>` key. Specifically, you'll need to implement completion for the `echo` and `exit` builtins.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then send the following inputs, simulating user input and tab presses:

      1.  **Input:** `ech`<TAB>
          * The tester expects the prompt to display `echo ` after the tab press.

      2.  **Input:** `exi`<TAB>
          * The tester expects the prompt to display `exit ` after the tab press.

      The tester checks if the completion works as expected and if your shell outputs the correct output for `echo` and `exit` command.

      ### Notes

      - We recommend using a library like [readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline) for your implementation. Most modern shells and REPLs (like the Python REPL) use readline under the hood. While you may need to override some of its default behaviors, it's typically less work than starting from scratch.
      - Different shells handle autocompletion differently. For consistency, we recommend using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for development and testing.

      In this stage, you'll extend your shell's tab completion to handle commands with arguments.

      Your shell should now not only complete the command itself but also correctly handle the subsequent arguments that the user types.
      This means that after completing the command with `<TAB>`, it should allow the user to continue typing arguments, and those arguments should also be interpreted correctly.
      You'll need to ensure commands like `echo ` and `type` autocomplete and still function correctly with arguments.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tests will simulate user input with tab presses and will execute builtin commands, similar to the previous stage, with added arguments:

      1.  **Input:** `ech`<TAB> `hello`<ENTER>
          *   The tester expects the shell to first complete the `ech` to `echo` after `<TAB>`, then accept the `hello` argument, and after the `<ENTER>` key press, execute `echo hello`.
          *   The shell should output `hello`.

      2.  **Input:** `typ`<TAB> `type`<ENTER>
           *   The tester expects the shell to first complete `typ` to `type` after `<TAB>`, then accept the `type` argument, and after the `<ENTER>` key press, execute `type type`.
           *   The shell should output `type is a shell builtin`.

      The tester will verify that your shell properly completes the commands and executes the commands with the given arguments.

      In this stage, you'll refine your shell's tab completion behavior to handle cases where the user types an invalid command.

      When the user types a command that is not a known builtin and presses `<TAB>`, your shell should not attempt to autocomplete it. Instead, it should just keep what the user typed and should ring a bell.
      This means that if you type "xyz" and press `<TAB>`, the command should not change and you should hear a bell indicating that there are no valid completion options for "xyz".

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tests will simulate the user typing an invalid command and pressing the `<TAB>` key:

      Your shell should now be able to complete commands that are not built-ins, but exist as executable files in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
      When the user types the beginning of an external command and presses `<TAB>`, your shell should complete the command to the full executable file name.
      This means that if you have a command `custom_executable` in the path and type `custom` and press `<TAB>`, the shell should complete that to `custom_executable`.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      Before executing your shell, the tester will create an executable file named `custom_executable` and add its directory to the `PATH`.

      The test will simulate the user typing the start of the external command and pressing `<TAB>`:

      1.  **Input:** `custom`<TAB>
          *   The tester types "custom" and presses `<TAB>`. The tester expects that the prompt line changes to <code>custom_executable  </code>.

      In this stage, you'll implement tab completion for executables, specifically when multiple executables share a common prefix.

      When the user types a command prefix and presses `<TAB>`, your shell should:

      - Identify all executables in the `PATH` that match the prefix.
      - If there are multiple matches,
        - On the first TAB press, just ring a bell. (`\a` rings the bell)
        - On the second TAB press, print all the matching executables separated by 2    spaces, on the next line, and follow it with the prompt on a new line.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then set up a specific `PATH` and place multiple executables starting with a common prefix into different directories in the `PATH`. Finally, it will type the common prefix, and then press the Tab key twice.

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      $ xyz_<TAB><TAB>
      xyz_bar  xyz_baz  xyz_quz
      $ xyz_
      ```

      The tester will verify that:

      1. Your shell displays the prompt with the common prefix after receiving the partial command.
      2. Upon the first Tab key press, your shell prints a bell character.
      3. Upon the second Tab key press, your shell prints the list of matching executables separated by 2 spaces, on the next line, and follow it with the prompt on a new line.

      In this stage, you'll extend your shell's tab completion to handle cases with multiple matching executables where one is a prefix of another.

      When the user types a partial command and presses the Tab key, your shell should attempt to complete the command name. If there are multiple executable files in the PATH that match the prefix, and one of those matches is a prefix of another, then the shell should complete to the longest common prefix of all matching executables. If there is only one match after performing completion, then the shell should complete the command name as in previous stages.

      For example, if `xyz_foo`, `xyz_foo_bar`, and `xyz_foo_bar_baz` are all available executables and the user types `xyz_` and presses tab, then your shell should complete the command to `xyz_foo`. If the user then types `_` and presses tab again, it should complete to `xyz_foo_bar`. If the user then types `_` and presses tab again, it should complete to `xyz_foo_bar_baz`.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then set up a specific `PATH` and place executables `xyz_foo`, `xyz_foo_bar`, and `xyz_foo_bar_baz` into different directories in the `PATH`. Finally, it will type `xyz_` and then press Tab, then type `_` and press Tab, then type `_` and press Tab.

      ```bash
      $ export PATH=/tmp/bar:$PATH
      $ export PATH=/tmp/baz:$PATH
      $ export PATH=/tmp/qux:$PATH

      $ xyz_<TAB>
      $ xyz_foo_<TAB>
      $ xyz_foo_bar_<TAB>
      $ xyz_foo_bar_baz
      ```
      Note: The prompt lines above are on the same line.

      The tester will verify that:

      1. After typing `xyz_` and pressing Tab, your shell completes to `xyz_foo`.
      2. After typing `_`, the prompt line matches `$ xyz_foo_`.
      3. After typing `_` and pressing Tab, your shell completes to `xyz_foo_bar`.
      4. After typing `_`, the prompt line matches `$ xyz_foo_bar_`.
      5. After typing `_` and pressing Tab, your shell completes to `xyz_foo_bar_baz`.
      6. The prompt line matches `$ xyz_foo_bar_baz ` after the final completion.

      $ tail -f /tmp/foo/file-1 | head -n 5
      raspberry strawberry
      pear mango
      pineapple apple
      # (tester appends more lines to /tmp/foo/file-1)
      # (And expects the running command to keep printing new lines)
      This is line 4.
      This is line 5.

      In this stage, you'll implement support for pipelines involving more than two commands.

      Pipelines can chain multiple commands together, connecting the output of each command to the input of the next one.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then send commands involving pipelines with three or more stages:

      ```bash
      $ cat /tmp/foo/file | head -n 5 | wc
             5       5      10
      $ ls -la /tmp/foo | tail -n 5 | head -n 3 | grep "file"
      -rw-r--r-- 1 user user     5 Apr 29 10:06 file
      $
      ```

      The tester will check if the final output matches the expected output after the multi-stage pipeline execution.

      ### Notes

      -   This requires managing multiple pipes and processes.
      -   Ensure correct setup of stdin/stdout for each command in the chain (except the first command's stdin and the last command's stdout, which usually connect to the terminal or file redirections).
      -   Proper process cleanup and waiting are crucial.

      In this stage, you'll add support for [history](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-History-Builtins.html#index-history) as a shell builtin.

      ### The history builtin

      [history](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-History-Builtins.html#index-history) as a shell builtin that lists previously executed commands. Example usage: 
      ```bash
      $ history
          1  previous_command_1
          2  previous_command_2
          3  history
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then execute the `type history` command.

      ```bash
      $ type history
      history is a shell builtin
      $
      ```

      The tester will then execute the `type history` command and expect the output to be `history is a shell builtin`.

      In this stage, you'll implement the `history` builtin.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the `history` command:

      ```bash
      $ echo hello
      hello
      $ echo world
      world
      $ invalid_command
      invalid_command: command not found
      $ history
          1  echo hello
          2  echo world
          3  invalid_command
          4  history
      $
      ```

      The tester expects a history list with the commands that were executed, formatted and indexed like in the example above.

      ### Notes

      - Some shells like *zsh* don't add the `history` command to the history list, but the tester expects it to be present.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the up arrow to recall the history:

      $ echo world
      <UP ARROW>
      $ echo hello
      ```

      The tester will expect the previous commands to be displayed when the up arrow key is pressed.

      ### Notes

      - We recommend using a library like [readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline) for your implementation. Most modern shells and REPLs (like the Python REPL) use readline under the hood. While you may need to override some of its default behaviors, it's typically less work than starting from scratch.
