      Check if the command is `exit`:
      ```kotlin
      if (command == "exit") {
          // Exit the shell
      }
      ```

      Use `break` to exit the loop:
      ```kotlin
      if (command == "exit") {
          break
      }
      ```

      `break` exits the loop and allows the program to terminate naturally.
