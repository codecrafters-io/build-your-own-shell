      Use a `case` expression to match the command:
      ```elixir
      case command do
        "exit" -> # Exit the shell
        _ -> # Handle other commands
      end
      ```

      Stop recursing to let the program terminate naturally:
      ```elixir
      case command do
        "exit" -> :ok
        _ ->
          IO.puts("#{command}: command not found")
          loop()
      end
      ```

      When the command is `"exit"`, returning `:ok` instead of calling `loop()` ends the recursion and allows the program to terminate naturally.
