      Use recursion to create an infinite loop:
      ```elixir
      defp loop do
        # Display the prompt
        # Read the command
        # Print the error message

        loop()
      end
      ```

      In Elixir, recursion is the idiomatic way to loop. Calling `loop()` at the end of the function starts the cycle again, prompting for a new command after each one is processed.
