      Check if the command is `exit`:
      ```ruby
      command = command ? command.chomp : ""
      if command == "exit"
        # Exit the shell
      end
      ```

      `chomp` removes the trailing newline from the command before comparing.

      Use `break` to exit the loop:
      ```ruby
      if command == "exit"
        break
      end
      ```

      `break` exits the loop and allows the program to terminate naturally.
