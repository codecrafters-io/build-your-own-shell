      Use the [bufio.Reader.ReadString()](https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#Reader.ReadString) method:

      ```go
      # Captures the user's command in the "command" variable
      command, err := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin).ReadString('\n')
      ```

      The `ReadString()` method waits for the user to enter a command, and then returns it (including a newline) as a string.

    body_markdown: |-
      Use the [fmt#Println()](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#Println) method:

      ```go
      # Prints the "<command>: command not found" message
      fmt.Println(command[:len(command)-1] + ": command not found")
      ```

      Since `command` includes a trailing newline, use `command[:len(command)-1]` to remove it.
