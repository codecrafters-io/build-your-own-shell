      Check if the command is `exit`:
      ```go
      import "strings" 

      command = strings.TrimSpace(command)
      if command == "exit" {
        // Exit the shell
      }
      ```

      `strings.TrimSpace()` removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the command.

      Use `break` to exit the loop:
      ```go
      if command == "exit" {
        break
      }
      ```

      `break` exits the loop and allows the program to terminate naturally.
