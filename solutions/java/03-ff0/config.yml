      Wrap your code in a `while (true)` block:
      ```java
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      while (true) {
          // Display the prompt
          // Read the command
          // Print the error message
      }
      ```

      The `Scanner` is created outside the loop to avoid resetting it on each iteration. The loop runs indefinitely, prompting for a new command after each one is processed.
