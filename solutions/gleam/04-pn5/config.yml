      Use a `case` expression to check if the command is `exit`:
      ```gleam
      case cmd {
        "exit" -> // Exit the shell
        _ -> // Handle other commands
      }
      ```

      Pattern matching with `case` is the idiomatic way to branch on values in Gleam.

      Return `Nil` instead of recursing to terminate the program:
      ```gleam
      case cmd {
        "exit" -> Nil
        _ -> {
          io.println(cmd <> ": command not found")
          main()
        }
      }
      ```

      By not calling `main()` recursively, the function returns and the program terminates naturally.
