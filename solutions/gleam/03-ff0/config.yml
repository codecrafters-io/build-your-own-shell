      In Gleam, you can implement a loop using recursion. Call `main()` at the end of the function to restart the cycle:
      ```gleam
      pub fn main() {
        // Display the prompt
        // Read the command
        // Print the error message
        main()
      }
      ```

      The recursive call to `main()` keeps the shell running indefinitely after each command is processed.
