      Use `io.read_line()` to read user input:

      ```gleam
      # Captures the user's command in the "command" variable
      let _ = case io.read_line()
      ```

      The `read_line()` function waits for the user to enter a command, and then returns it (including a newline) as `Ok(string)`.

    body_markdown: |-
      Use `io.println()` to print the message:

      ```gleam
      import gleam/string

      # Prints the "<command>: command not found" message
      let cmd = string.trim(command)
      io.println(cmd <> ": command not found")
      ```

      - The `<>` operator concatenates strings.
      - The `string.trim()` function removes surrounding whitespace, including the trailing newline from `command`.
