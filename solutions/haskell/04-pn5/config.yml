      Check if the command is `"exit"`:
      ```haskell
      if command == "exit"
          then -- Exit the shell
          else -- Handle the command
      ```

      Use `pure ()` to stop the recursion and let the program terminate naturally:

      ```haskell
      if command == "exit"
          then pure ()
          else do
              putStrLn $ command ++ ": command not found"
              main
      ```

      By returning `pure ()` instead of calling `main` recursively, the program exits the loop and terminates.
