      Use recursion to create an infinite loop by calling `main` at the end of the `do` block:

      ```haskell
      main :: IO ()
      main = do
          -- Display the prompt
          -- Read the command
          -- Print the error message
          main
      ```

      In Haskell, recursion is the idiomatic way to implement loops. The recursive call to `main` restarts the prompt after each command is processed.
