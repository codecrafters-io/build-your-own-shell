      Check if the command is `exit`:
      ```csharp
      if (command == "exit")
      {
          // Exit the shell
      }
      ```

      Use `break` to exit the loop:
      ```csharp
      if (command == "exit")
      {
          break;
      }
      ```

      `break` exits the loop and allows the program to terminate naturally.
