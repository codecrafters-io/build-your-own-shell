      Use the [`fgets()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fgets.php) function to read a line from STDIN:

      ```php
      // Captures the user's command in the "$command" variable
      $command = fgets(STDIN);
      ```

      The `fgets()` function reads a line from standard input and returns it (including the newline) as a string.

    body_markdown: |-
      Use the [`fwrite()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fwrite.php) function to write the message to standard output:

      ```php
      // Prints the "<command>: command not found" message
      $command = rtrim($command, "\r\n");
      fwrite(STDOUT, $command . ": command not found\n");
      ```

      Since `$command` includes a trailing newline, use the [`rtrim()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.rtrim.php) function to remove it before printing.
